Title: Odds Ratio Calculation for GAM & GLM
Author: Patrick Schratz
Maintainer: Patrick Schratz <patrick.schratz@gmail.com>
Description: Simplified odds ratio calculation of GAM(M)s & GLM(M)s. 
    Provides structured output (data frame) of all predictors and their corresponding odds ratios 
    for further analyses. It helps to avoid false references of predictors and increments by
    specifying these parameters in a list instead of using 'exp(coef(model))' 
    (standard approach of odds ratio calculation for GLMs) which just returns a plain numeric output. 
    For GAM(M)s, odds ratio calculation is highly simplified with this package since it takes care of
    the multiple 'predict()' calls of the chosen predictor while holding other predictors constant.
    Also, this package allows odds ratio calculation of percentage steps across the whole
    predictor distribution range for GAM(M)s.
